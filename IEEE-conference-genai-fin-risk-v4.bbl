      \field{abstract}{Credit risk analysis is a process that involves a wide range of complex cognitive abilities. Automating the credit risk analysis process using Large Language Models can bring transformative changes to the finance industry, but not without appropriate measures to ensure trustworthy responses. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-engineering method that enhances the ability of Large Language Models to generate reliable credit risk reports - Labeled Guide Prompting ({LGP}). {LGP} consists of: (1) providing annotated few-shot examples to the {LLM} that denote sets of tokens in an exemplary prompt that are of greater importance when generating sets of tokens in the exemplary response and (2) providing text in the prompt that describes the direction, pathways and interactions between variables from a Bayesian network used for credit risk assessment, thus promoting abductive reasoning. Using data from 100 credit applications, we demonstrate that {LGP} enables {LLMs} to generate credit risk reports that are preferred by human credit analysts (in 60-90\% of cases) over alternative credit risk reports created by their peers in a blind review. Additionally, we found a statistically significant improvement (p-value \&lt; 10âˆ’ 10) in the insightfulness of the responses generated using {LGP} when compared to identical prompts without {LGP} components. We conclude that Labeled Guide Prompting can enhance {LLM} performance in complex problem-solving tasks, achieving a level of competency comparable to or exceeding human experts.}

      \field{abstract}{Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as a distinctive financing mechanism, linking borrowers with lenders through online platforms. However, P2P lending faces the challenge of information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue by leveraging the textual descriptions provided by borrowers during the loan application process. Our methodology involves processing these textual descriptions using a Large Language Model ({LLM}), a powerful tool capable of discerning patterns and semantics within the text. Transfer learning is applied to adapt the {LLM} to the specific task at hand. Our results derived from the analysis of the Lending Club dataset show that the risk score generated by {BERT}, a widely used {LLM}, significantly improves the performance of credit risk classifiers. However, the inherent opacity of {LLM}-based systems, coupled with uncertainties about potential biases, underscores critical considerations for regulatory frameworks and engenders trust-related concerns among end-users, opening new avenues for future research in the dynamic landscape of P2P lending and artificial intelligence.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models ({LLMs}) to interpret textual data from company earnings calls and assess default likelihood. Using {ChatGPT} to analyze earnings call transcripts, I find that {LLM}-derived default likelihoods enhance the predictability of corporate bond credit spreads, independent of stock prices and liquidity measures. By comparing actual credit spreads with counterfactual spreads predicted using {LLM}-based default likelihoods, I show that {LLMs} reduce serial correlation in credit spreads, indicating less under-reaction to information. This research highlights {LLMs}' role in improving market efficiency by providing a consistent method for processing textual data.}
